# Project Overview

This project was handed over to me from Udacity to be used as a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was already included from Udacity but it was incomplete and now it is completed by me.
Clone or download this project to your machine to see the magic before your eyes.


# Steps for Success

1. Wrote a new test suite named `"The menu"`
- Using Chrome Dev Tools allowed me to test the class 'menu-hidden' on <body> by toggling the side menu. Used Jquery to select the BODY element. The click() event helped ensured that the 'menu-hidden' class existed to make sure the function worked.

2. Wrote a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
- app.js runs 'loadFeed' function and by doing so the .feed HTML checks all entries.

3. Wrote a test suite named `"New Feed Selection".
-The HTML content is different from the second feed and the first feed , by using this test both feeds can be easily compared to see what is different.
