# Project Overview

This project was handed over to me from Udacity to be used as a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was already included from Udacity but it was incomplete and now it is completed by me.

# Steps for Success

1. Wrote a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensured that it has a URL defined _and_ that the URL is not empty

2. Wrote a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensured it has a name defined.

3. Wrote a new test suite named `"The menu"`

4. Wrote a test that ensured the menu element that is hidden by default.

5. Wrote a test that ensured the menu and changes the visibility when the menu icon is clicked on. The test also has two expectations which is: the menu displays itself when clicked on, and hides when it is clicked on again.

6. Wrote a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.

7. Wrote a test that ensured the `loadFeed` function.

8. Wrote a test suite named `"New Feed Selection".

9. Wrote a test that ensured a new feed which is loaded by the `loadFeed` function.
